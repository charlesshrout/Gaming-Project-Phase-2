GAMING REVIEWS WITH CHUCK

Project Pitch: A react web page that lets the user sort through multiple reviews of games (reviewed by me). The review will provide ample information such as a pros/cons section, what platforms the game is available on, and the ability to mark the game as played or not. The user will also have the ability to submit a new review of a game.

As a user, I can:
- Search genres of games or a specific game by name
- I can select whether I have played the game or not
- Click on a specific review and see a pros/cons section and the cheapest price of that game 
- Submit a new review for a game and see it appear on the game review list
