GAMING REVIEWS WITH CHUCK

Project Pitch: A react web page that lets the user sort through multiple reviews of games (reviewed by me). The review will provide ample information such as a pros/cons section, what platforms the game is available on, and the ability to mark the game as played or not. The user will also have the ability to submit a new review of a game.

As a user, I can:
- Search genres of games or a specific game by name
- I can select whether I have played the game or not
- Click on a specific review and see a pros/cons section and the cheapest price of that game 
- Submit a new review for a game and see it appear on the game review list


PLAN TO EXECUTE:
- Decide what features I CAN implement first, not what I want.
- Create data base with ALL games and include image and review information
- Create an HTML and CSS boiler plate format based of previous labs and projects that have features that I am implementing into my project
- Create React components needed for project
- Fetch my game data and pass it through react compenents to respective places
- Begin finalizing CSS and debugging process 
- If core application is complete with time left, try to attempt stretch goals.
- Practice showing off key features and code for presentation

MY CHALLENGES:
- Getting CSS to the standard I am envisioning
- Having my Game Cards click and display more review information
- Being able to search by genre OR name


STRETCH GOALS:
- Can I make my CSS as smooth as possible?
- Can I sort my data by review score?
- Can I hide an "easter egg" in my application?
