  return <h1 className= "about-text">Most review sources play a game for a few hours before giving it a review. But is this an accurate way to judge whether to spend all that hard earned cash on a game? The answer is NO! Luckily, Chuck has a system in place to give solid reviews you know you can trust. How? In order for a game to be reviewed, over 100 hours must be logged into the game and every game review has to take replayability into account. No one wants a game you only play once, so Chuck makes sure you know a high score equals high replayability.</h1>;
